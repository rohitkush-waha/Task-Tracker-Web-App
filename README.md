# Task-Tracker-Web-App



**Task Tracker Web App**

**Project Description:**
Create a simple task tracker web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will help you learn the basics of front-end web development and JavaScript interactions.

**Features:**

1. **Task List:** Display a list of tasks with a title and description.

2. **Add Task:** Allow users to add new tasks with a title and description.

3. **Delete Task:** Provide an option to delete tasks from the list.

4. **Mark Task as Completed:** Add a checkbox to mark tasks as completed or not.

5. **Filter Tasks:** Implement a filtering mechanism to filter tasks based on their completion status (all, completed, active).

6. **Storage:** Store tasks locally in the browser using localStorage so that tasks are not lost when the page is refreshed.

**Learning Opportunities:**

- HTML/CSS: You'll create a simple and user-friendly interface to interact with tasks.
- JavaScript: You'll handle user interactions, manage tasks, and update the UI dynamically.
- Local Storage: You'll learn how to use localStorage to persist data on the client-side.
- DOM Manipulation: You'll manipulate the Document Object Model to update the task list.

**Extensions:**

Once you've completed the basic project, you can add more features to make it more advanced:

- Edit tasks: Allow users to edit task titles and descriptions.
- Due dates: Add due dates to tasks and allow sorting based on due dates.
- User authentication: Implement user accounts to save tasks individually.
- Task categories: Let users organize tasks into categories or projects.
- Mobile responsiveness: Make your app mobile-friendly using media queries.

This project will not only help you practice JavaScript but also improve your front-end development skills. Plus, it's a useful tool for personal task management.
